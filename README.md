## AirBnB Clone

### Description
This project is entails the following:
- A _command interpreter__ to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
- A _website_ (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A _database_ or _files_ that store data (data = objects)
- An _API_ that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

---

__Command Interpreter__
The command interpreter part of the this clone allows us to do the following:
- create your data model
- manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
- store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
